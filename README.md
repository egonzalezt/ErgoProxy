ErgoProxy is a unique project inspired by the enigmatic world of the anime [Ergo Proxy](https://myanimelist.net/anime/790/Ergo_Proxy). It serves as a sophisticated reverse proxy solution designed to seamlessly connect external services with the "Gov Carpeta" service. By leveraging the power of RabbitMQ, ErgoProxy acts as an intermediary, facilitating secure communication and data exchange between disparate systems.

## Description

ErgoProxy goes beyond conventional proxy solutions by drawing inspiration from its namesake anime. In the spirit of characters like Pino and Vincent, ErgoProxy becomes the conduit for communication, navigating the complexities of technology. Just as Pino and Vincent traverse the enigmatic world of the anime, ErgoProxy bridges the gap between external services and the centralized Gov Carpeta service, ensuring seamless and secure communication pathways.

## Features

### Reverse Proxy Functionality

ErgoProxy seamlessly routes incoming requests from external services to the Gov Carpeta service, shielding it from direct exposure to the external environment.

### RabbitMQ Integration

Leveraging RabbitMQ, ErgoProxy establishes a robust messaging system, enabling asynchronous communication between services. This facilitates efficient data exchange and enhances system reliability.

### Security

ErgoProxy prioritizes security, implementing robust encryption protocols to safeguard sensitive data during transit. With built-in authentication mechanisms, it ensures that only authorized entities can access the Gov Carpeta service.

### Scalability

Designed for scalability, ErgoProxy efficiently manages varying levels of traffic and workload demands. Its flexible architecture allows for seamless expansion to accommodate evolving business needs.
